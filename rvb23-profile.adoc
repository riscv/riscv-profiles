= RVB23 Profile

//: This is the Preamble

[WARNING]
.This document is in the development state.
====
Do not use for implementations.  Assume everything can change.
====

== Introduction

This document captures the current proposal for the RVB23 profile
family. RVB23 is intended to be the first major release of the RVB
series of RISC-V Application Processor Profile.

RVB profiles are intended to be used for customized 64-bit application
processors that will run rich OS stacks, but usually as a custom build
of standard OS source-code distributions.  The approach is to provide
a large guaranteed set of relatively inexpensive and/or widely
beneficial features but allow optionality for more expensive and/or
more targeted extensions.

Unlike the RVA profiles, it is explicitly a non-goal of RVB profiles
to provide a single standard ISA interface supporting a wide variety
of binary kernel and binary application software distributions.
However, individual software ecosystems may build upon RVB profiles to
produce a more targeted standard interface for a certain market.

== RVB23 Profiles

Only user-mode (RVB23U64) and supervisor-mode (RVB23S64) profiles are
specified in this family.

=== RVB23U64 Profile

The RVB23U64 profile specifies the ISA features available to user-mode
execution environments in 64-bit RVB applications processors.  This is
the most important profile within the application processor family in
terms of the amount of software that targets this profile.

==== RVB23U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVB23U64 and is little-endian.  As
per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

==== RVB23U64 Mandatory Extensions

The following mandatory extensions are also in RVA22U64.

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.
- *A* Atomic instructions.
- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.
- *C* Compressed Instructions.
- *Zicsr*  CSR instructions.  These are implied by presence of F.
- *Zicntr* Base counters and timers.
- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.
- *Ziccif* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
  coherence PMAs must support instruction fetch, and any instruction
  fetches of naturally aligned power-of-2 sizes up to min(ILEN,XLEN)
  (i.e., 32 bits for RVB23) are atomic.
- *Ziccrse* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support RsrvEventual.
- *Ziccamoa* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support AMOArithmetic.
- *Zicclsm* Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the
  cacheability and coherence PMAs must be supported.
- *Za64rs* Reservation sets are contiguous, naturally aligned, and a
   maximum of 64 bytes.
- *Zihintpause* Pause instruction.
- *Zba* Address computation.
- *Zbb* Basic bit manipulation.
- *Zbs* Single-bit instructions.
- *Zic64b* Cache blocks must be 64 bytes in size, naturally aligned in the
address space.
- *Zicbom* Cache-Block Management Operations.
- *Zicbop* Cache-Block Prefetch Operations.
- *Zicboz* Cache-Block Zero Operations.
- *Zkt* Data-independent execution time.

The following mandatory extensions are also present in RVA23U64:

- *Zihintntl* Non-temporal locality hints.
- *Zicond* Conditional Zeroing instructions.
- *Zimop* Maybe Operations.
- *Zcmop* Compressed Maybe Operations.
- *Zcb* Additional 16b compressed instructions.
- *Zfa* Additional scalar FP instructions.
- *Zawrs* Wait on reservation set.

==== RVB23U64 Optional Extensions

RVB23U64 has 18 profile options listed below.

===== Localized Options

The following extensions are localized options in both RVA23U64 and RVB23U64:

- *Zvbc* Vector carryless multiply.
- *Zvkng* Vector Crypto NIST Algorithms including GHASH.
- *Zvksg* Vector Crypto ShangMi Algorithms including GHASH.

The following extensions options are localized options in RVB23U64 but
are not present in RVA23U64:

- *Zvkg* Vector GHASH instructions
- *Zvknc* Vector Crypto NIST Algorithms with carryless multiply
- *Zvksc* Vector Crypto ShangMi Algorithms with carryless multiply

NOTE: RVA profiles mandate the higher-performing but more expensive
GHASH options when adding vector crypto.  To reduce implementation cost, RVB
profiles also allow these carryless multiply options (Zvknc and Zvksc)
to implement GCM efficiently, with GHASH available as a separate
option.

- *Zkn* Scalar Crypto NIST Algorithms.
- *Zks* Scalar Crypto ShangMi Algorithms.

NOTE: RVA23 profiles drop support for scalar crypto as an option, as
the vector extension is now mandatory in RVA23.  RVB23 profiles
support scalar crypto, as the vector extension is optional in RVB23.

===== Development Options

The following are new development options intended to become mandatory in RVB24U64:

- *Zabha* Byte and Halfword Atomic Memory Operations 
- *Zacas* Compare-and-swap
- *Ziccamoc* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs
  must provide AMOCASQ level PMA support.
- *Zama16b* Misaligned loads, stores, and AMOs to main memory regions that do not cross a naturally aligned 16-byte boundary are atomic.

===== Expansion Options

The following extensions are mandatory in RVA23U64 but are expansion
options in RVB23U64:

- *Zfhmin* Half-Precision Floating-point transfer and convert.

- *V* Vector Extension.

NOTE: Unclear if other Zve* extensions should also be supported in RVB.

- *Zvfhmin* Vector FP16 conversion instructions.
- *Zvbb* Vector bitmanip extension.
- *Zvkt* Vector data-independent execution time.

The following extensions are expansion options in both RVA23U64 and RVB23U64:

- *Zfh* Scalar Half-Precision Floating-Point (FP16).
- *Zbc* Scalar carryless multiply.
- *Zvfh* Vector half-precision floating-point (FP16).
- *Zfbfmin* Scalar BF16 FP conversions.
- *Zvfbfmin* Vector BF16 FP conversions.
- *Zvfbfwma* Vector BF16 widening mul-add.

The following are RVA23U64 development options as they are intended to
become mandatory in RVA24U64 profile, but are considered expansion
options for RVB23U64 as they are not intended to be made mandatory in
RVB profiles:

- *Zvbc* Vector carryless multiply.

===== Transitory Options

There are no transitory options in RVB23U64.

==== RVB23U64 Recommendations

Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.

=== RVB23S64 Profile

The RVB23S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVB23S64 is based on privileged architecture version
1.13.

NOTE: Priv 1.13 is still being defined.

==== RVB23S64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVB23S64 and is little-endian.
The `ecall` instruction operates as per the unprivileged architecture
specification.  An `ecall` in user mode causes a contained trap to
supervisor mode.  An `ecall` in supervisor mode causes a requested
trap to the execution environment.

==== RVB23S64 Mandatory Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are mandatory:

- The RVB23S64 mandatory unprivileged extensions include all the
mandatory unprivileged extensions in RVB23U64.

- *Zifencei*  Instruction-Fetch Fence.

NOTE: Zifencei is mandated as it is the only standard way to support
instruction-cache coherence in RVB23 application processors.  A new
instruction-cache coherence mechanism is under development
(tentatively named Zjid) which might be added as an option in the
future.

The following privileged extensions are mandatory, and are also
mandatory in RVA23S64.

- *Ss1p13*  Supervisor Architecture version 1.13.

NOTE: Ss1p13 supersedes Ss1p12 but is not yet ratified.

- *Svnapot* NAPOT Translation Contiguity

NOTE: Svnapot is very low cost to provide, so is made mandatory even
in RVB.

- *Svbare* The `satp` mode Bare must be supported.

- *Sv39* Page-Based 39-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svade* Page-fault exceptions are raised when a page is accessed
   when A bit is clear, or written when D bit is clear.

- *Ssccptr* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
   coherence PMAs must support hardware page-table reads.

- *Sstvecd* `stvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0
  (Direct).  When `stvec.MODE=Direct`, `stvec.BASE` must be capable of
  holding any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- *Sstvala* stval must be written with the faulting virtual address
  for load, store, and instruction page-fault, access-fault, and
  misaligned exceptions, and for breakpoint exceptions other than
  those caused by execution of the EBREAK or C.EBREAK instructions.
  For illegal-instruction exceptions, stval must be written with the
  faulting instruction.

- *Sscounterenw* For any hpmcounter that is not read-only zero, the
   corresponding bit in scounteren must be writable.

- *Svpbmt* Page-Based Memory Types

- *Svinval* Fine-Grained Address-Translation Cache Invalidation

- *Sstc* supervisor-mode timer interrupts.

- *Sscofpmf* Count Overflow and Mode-Based Filtering.

- *Ssu64xl* `sstatus.UXL` must be capable of holding the value 2
(i.e., UXLEN=64 must be supported).

==== RVB23S64 Optional Extensions

RVB23S64 has the same unprivileged options as RVB23U64,

RVB23S64 has the same six privileged options (Sv48, Sv57, Svadu,
Sscofpmf, Zkr, H) as RVA23S64.

===== Localized Options

There are no privileged localized options in RVB23S64.

===== Development Options

There are no privileged development options in RVB23S64.

===== Expansion Options

The following privileged expansion options are mandatory in RVA22S64 but options in RVB23S64:

- *Ssnpm* Pointer masking, with `senvcfg.PME` supporting at minimum,
   settings PMLEN=0 and PMLEN=7.

The following hypervisor extension and mandates were also in RVA22S64
and are available as an expansion option in RVB23S64:

- *H* The hypervisor extension.

When the hypervisor extension is implemented, the following are also mandatory:

- *Ssstateen* Supervisor-mode view of the state-enable extension.  The
   supervisor-mode (`sstateen0-3`) and hypervisor-mode (`hstateen0-3`)
   state-enable registers must be provided.

- *Shcounterenw* For any `hpmcounter` that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit in `hcounteren` must be writable.

- *Shvstvala* `vstval` must be written in all cases described above for `stval`.

- *Shtvala* `htval` must be written with the faulting guest physical
   address in all circumstances permitted by the ISA.

- *Shvstvecd* `vstvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).
  When `vstvec.MODE`=Direct, `vstvec.BASE` must be capable of holding
  any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- *Shvsatpa* All translation modes supported in `satp` must be supported in `vsatp`.

- *Shgatpa* For each supported virtual memory scheme SvNN supported in
  `satp`, the corresponding hgatp SvNNx4 mode must be supported.  The
  `hgatp` mode Bare must also be supported.

- If the hypervisor extension is implemented and pointer masking
  (Ssnpm) is supported then `henvcfg.PME` must support at minimum,
  settings PMLEN=0 and PMLEN=7.

The following privileged expansion options are also present in RVA23S64:

- *Sv48* Page-Based 48-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Sv57* Page-Based 57-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svadu* Hardware A/D bit updates.

- *Zkr*  Entropy CSR.

- *Svadu* Hardware A/D bit updates.

- *Sdext* Debug triggers

- *Ssstrict* No non-conforming extensions are present.  Attempts to
   execute unimplemented opcodes or access unimplemented CSRs in the
   standard or reserved encoding spaces raises an illegal instruction
   exception that results in a contained trap to the supervisor-mode
   trap handler.

NOTE: Ssstrict does not prescribe behavior for the custom encoding
spaces or CSRs.

- *Svvptc* Transitions from invalid to valid PTEs will be visible in
   bounded time without an explicit SFENCE.

==== RVB23S64 Recommendations

- Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
  exceptions when attempting to execute unimplemented opcodes.

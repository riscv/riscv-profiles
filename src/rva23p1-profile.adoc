= RVA23.1 Profiles

//: This is the Preamble

== Introduction

This document specifies the RVA23.1 profile
family. RVA23.1 is the first minor release intended to expand upon
the RVA23 major release of the RVB series of RISC-V Application 
Processor Profile.

RVB profiles are intended to be used for customized 64-bit application
processors that will run rich OS stacks, but usually as a custom build
of standard OS source-code distributions.  The approach is to provide
a large guaranteed set of relatively inexpensive and/or widely
beneficial features but allow optionality for more expensive and/or
more targeted extensions.

== RVA23.1 Profiles

The RVA23.1 profiles are intended to align implementations of RISC-V
64-bit application processors to allow binary software ecosystems to
plan for future major releases by adding a small number of 
discoverable coarse-grain options to the existing major release.
It is the intetion that these optional extensions will be included
in the the next major release.

This is a minor release of the RVA23 Profile series. As such, they
do not contain any new mandatory extensions and are expected to be
built on top of the extensions listed in the RVA23 profiles. For
the sake of simplicity when referring to this profile in code or
use in a command line argument, all instances of the period will
be replaced with the lower case letter 'p', as in `rva23p1s64`.

Only supervisor-mode (`rva23p1s64`) profiles are specified in this
family.

=== `rva23p1s64` Profile

The `rva23p1s64` profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  `rva23p1s64` is designed to be added on to and requires 
and implementation of `rva23s64` for Mandatory Base and Mandatory 
Extensions. `rva23p1s64` only provides new Development Options and
Expansion Options on top of the `rva23s64`.

==== `rva23p1s64` Optional Extensions

===== Localized Options

There are no privileged localized options in RVA23S64.

===== Development Options

The following are new privileged development options in RVA23.1S64:

- *Svrsw60t59b* PTE reserved-for-software bits.

- *Ssdbltrap* Double Trap.

- *Sscfg* Supervisor Counter Delegation.

===== Expansion Options

The following are new privileged expansion options in RVA23.1S64:

- *Ssctr* Control Transfer Records, CTR.

NOTE: *Ssctr* also implies inclusion of *Sscsrind* (indirect CSR access)

- *Ssqosid* QoS identifiers.

===== Transitory Options

There are no privileged transitory options in `rva23p1s64`.

== Glossary of ISA Extensions

The following extensions have not yet been incorporated into the RISC-V
Instruction Set Manual; the hyperlinks lead to their separate specifications.

- https://riscv.atlassian.net/browse/RVS-1005[Sscfg]
- https://riscv.atlassian.net/browse/RVS-973[Ssctr]

The following privileged ISA extensions are defined in Volume II
of the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual[RISC-V Instruction Set Manual].

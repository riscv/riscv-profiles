== RVA23.1 Profiles

The RVA23.1 profiles are intended to align implementations of RISC-V
64-bit application processors to allow binary software ecosystems to
plan for future major releases by adding a small number of 
discoverable coarse-grain options to the existing major release.
It is not implied that these extensions will be required in the
next future release, only that these are candidates for that.

This is a minor release of the RVA23 Profile series. As such, they
do not contain any mandatory extensions and are expected to be
built on top of the extensions lised in the RVA23 profiles.

Only supervisor-mode (RVA23.1S64) profiles are specified in this family.

=== RVA23.1S64 Profile

The RVA23.1S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVA23.1S64 is designed to be added on to and requires 
and implementation of RVA23S64 for Mandatory Base and Mandatory 
Extensions. RVA23.1S64 only provides new Development Options and
Expansion Options on top of the RVA23S64.

==== RVA23.1S64 Optional Extensions

===== Localized Options

There are no privileged localized options in RVA23S64.

===== Development Options

The following are new privileged development options in RVA23.1S64:

- *Svrsw60t59b* PTE reserved-for-software bits.

- *Ssdbltrap* Double Trap.

- *Sscfg* Supervisor Counter Delegation.

===== Expansion Options

The following are new privileged expansion options in RVA23.1S64:

- *Ssctr* Control Transfer Records, CTR.

NOTE: *Ssctr* also implies inclusion of *Sscsrind* (indirect CSR access)

- *Ssqosid* QoS identifiers.

===== Transitory Options

There are no privileged transitory options in RVA23S64.

==== RVA23.164 Recommendations

- Implementations are strongly recommended to raise
  illegal-instruction exceptions when attempting to execute
  unimplemented opcodes or access unimplemented CSRs.

== Glossary of ISA Extensions

The following extensions have not yet been incorporated into the RISC-V
Instruction Set Manual; the hyperlinks lead to their separate specifications.

- https://riscv.atlassian.net/browse/RVS-3647[Svrsw60t59b]
- https://riscv.atlassian.net/browse/RVS-1005[Sscfg]
- https://riscv.atlassian.net/browse/RVS-973[Ssctr]

The following privileged ISA extensions are defined in Volume II
of the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual[RISC-V Instruction Set Manual].

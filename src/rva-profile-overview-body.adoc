== RVA Profiles Rationale

RISC-V was designed to provide a highly modular and extensible
instruction set and includes a large and growing set of standard
extensions, where each standard extension is a bundle of
instruction-set features.  This is no different than other industry
ISAs that continue to add new ISA features.  Unlike other ISAs,
however, RISC-V has a broad set of contributors and implementers, and
also allows users to add their own custom extensions.  For some deep
embedded markets, highly customized processor configurations are
desirable for efficiency, and all software is compiled, ported, and/or
developed in-house by the same organization for that specific
processor configuration.  However, for other markets that expect a
substantial fraction of software to be delivered to end-customers in
binary form, compatibility across multiple implementations from
different RISC-V vendors is required.

The RVIA ISA extension ratification process ensures that all processor
vendors have agreed to the specification of a standard extension if
present.  However, by themselves, the ISA extension specifications do
not guarantee that a certain set of standard extensions will be
present in all implementations.

*The primary goal of the RVA profiles is to align processor vendors
targeting binary software markets, so software can rely on the
existence of a certain set of ISA features in a particular generation
of RISC-V implementations.*

Alignment is not only for compatibility, but also to ensure RISC-V is
competitive in these markets.  The binary app markets are also
generally those with the most competitive performance requirements
(e.g., mobile, client, server).  RVIA cannot mandate the ISA features
that a RISC-V binary software ecosystem should use, as each ecosystem
will typically select the lowest-common denominator they empirically
observe in the deployed devices in their target markets.  But RVIA can
align hardware vendors to support a common set of features in each
generation through the RVA profiles.  Without proactive alignment
through RVA profiles, RISC-V will be uncompetitive, as even if a
particular vendor implements a certain feature, if other vendors do
not, then binary distributions will not generally use that feature and
all implementations will suffer.  While certain features may be
discoverable, and alternate code provided in case of presence/absence
of a feature, the added cost to support such options is only justified
for certain limited cases, and binary app markets will not support a
wide range of optional features, particularly for the nascent RISC-V
binary app ecosystems.

To maintain alignment and increase RISC-V competitiveness over time,
the mandatory set of extensions must increase over time in successive
generations of RVA profile.  (RVA profiles may eventually have to
deprecate previously mandatory instructions, but that is unlikely in
the near future.)  Note that the RISC-V ISA will continue to evolve,
regardless of whether a given software ecosystem settles on a certain
generation of profile as the baseline for their ecosystem for many
years or even decades.  There are many existing binary software
ecosystems, which will migrate to RISC-V and evolve at different rates,
and more new ones will doubtless be created over the hopefully long
lifetime of RISC-V.  High-performance application processors require
considerable investment, and no single binary app ecosystem can
justify the development costs of these processors, especially for
RISC-V in its early stage of adoption.

While the heart of the profile is the set of mandatory extensions,
there are several kinds of optional extension that serve important
roles in the profile.

The first kind are _localized_ _options_, whose presence or use
necessarily differs along geo-political and/or jurisdictional
boundaries, with crypto being the obvious example.  These will always
be optional.  At least for crypto, discovery has been found to be
perfectly acceptable to handle this optionality on other
architectures, as the use of the extensions is well contained in
certain libraries.

The second kind of optional extension is a _development_ _option_,
which represents a new ISA extension in an early part of its lifecycle
but which is intended to become mandatory in a later generation of the
RVA profile.  Processor vendors and software toolchain providers will
have varying development schedules, and providing an optional phase in
a new extension's lifecycle provides some flexibility while
maintaining overall alignment, and is particularly appropriate when
hardware or software development for the extension is complex.
Denoting an extension as a _development_ _option_ signals to the
community that development should be prioritized for such extensions
as they will become mandatory.

The third kind of optional extension are _expansion_ _options_, which
are those that may have a large implementation cost but are not always
needed in a particular platform, and which can be readily handled by
discovery. These are also intended to remain available as expansion
options in future versions of the profile.  Several supervisor-mode
extensions fall into this category, e.g., Sv57, which has a notable
PPA impact over Sv48 and is not needed on smaller platforms.  Some
unprivileged extensions that may fall into this category are possible
future matrix extensions.  These have large implementation costs, and
use of matrix instructions can be readily supported with discovery and
alternate math libraries.

The fourth kind of optional extensions are _transitory_ _options_,
where it is not clear if the extension will change to a mandatory,
localized, or expansion option, or be possibly dropped over time.
Cryptography provides some examples where earlier cyphers have been
broken and are now deprecated.  RVIA used this mechanism to enable
scalar crypto until vector crypto was ready.  Software security
features may also be in this category, with examples of deprecated
security features occuring in other architectures.  As another
example, the recent avalanche of new numeric datatypes for AI/ML may
eventually subside with a few survivors actually being used longer
term.  Denoting an option as transitory signals to the community that
this extension may be removed in a future profile, though the time
scale may span many years.

Except for the localized options, it could be argued that other three
kinds of option could be left out of profiles.  Binary distributions
of applications willing to invest in discovery can use an optional
extension, and customers compiling their own applications can take
advantage of the feature on a particular implementation, even when
that system is mostly running binary distributions that ignore the new
extension.  However, there is value in providing guidance to align
hardware vendors and software developers around what extensions are
worth implementing and worth discovering, by designating only a few
important features as profile options and limiting their granularity.

== RVM23 Profiles

The RVM23 profile is intended for microcontrollers, with the goal of
simplifying the demands on the software ecosystem particularly
toolchains and library suppliers.

The RVM23 profile only specifies unprivileged ISA features.  ISA
features related to interrupt and exception handling or privileged
execution are not included as these are often highly
platform-specific.  The separate RVM-CSI effort is tackling
source-code level portability for certain platform-level features.

A non-goal of RVM23 is to provide maximum flexibility for
microcontroller developers.  Maximum flexibility can already be
achieved using individual RISC-V extensions.  The goal of RVM23 is
mandate a common set of standard extensions to simplify software
support.

=== RVM23U32

RVM23U32 corresponds to a 32-bit address-space microcontroller.

NOTE: Initially only 32b RVM profiles are defined, but a corresponding
RVM64 profile can also be developed.

==== RVM23U32 Mandatory Base

RV32I is the mandatory base ISA for RVM23U32, and is little-endian.

NOTE: A separate RV32ME profile uses RV32E as the base ISA.

As per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

Misaligned loads and stores might not be supported.

NOTE: Software should not assume that misaligned loads and stores will
work, or that all misaligned loads and stores will necessarily cause a
trap.

==== RVM23U32 Mandatory Extensions

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.

NOTE: Mandating divide instructions versus only multiplies (Zmmul) is likely
controversial, but RVM is not intended for the smallest possible
microcontrollers, and including divide instructions reduces
optionality.

- *B* Bit-manipulation instructions.

- *Zicond* Conditional Zeroing instructions.

- *Zihintpause*

NOTE: These are hints, so implementations are allowed to treat as NOPs.

- *Zihintntl*

NOTE: These are hints, so implementations are allowed to treat as NOPs.

- *Zce* Code size extension.  The `jvt` CSR must be writable and
   support the jump table mode.

NOTE: Zce includes Zicsr. Whether and what support is mandated for
`jvt` in the profile is a topic for discussion.

- *Zicbop* Cache-Block Prefetch Operations.

NOTE: These are hints, so implementations are allowed to treat as NOPs.

- *Zimop* Maybe-Operations
- *Zcmop* Compressed Maybe-Operations

NOTE: Implementations can simply write zero to the destination register (for
Zimop) or treat as a NOP (for Zcmop), unless these instructions' behavior is
overridden by another extension.

==== RVM23U32 Optional Extensions

- *Zaamo* Atomic instructions.

NOTE: Many microcontroller systems will not have caches and so will
not naturally be able to support `Zalrsc`.

- *A* Atomic instructions.

NOTE: The assumption is that if Zalrsc is implemented on a
microcontroller, then Zaamo will also be implemented, so we do not
make Zalrsc available as a separate option.

- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.

NOTE: This profile does not support Zfinx and related options.  A
similar set of profiles, tentatively named RVN, would define Zfinx
systems.

- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.

- *V* Vector Extension.

- *P* Packed-SIMD Extension

NOTE: The P extension has not yet been frozen or ratified.

- *Zawrs* Wait on reservation set.

NOTE: Zawrs includes Zalrsc.

- *Zifencei* Instruction-fetch fence instruction.

NOTE: Zifencei is only an option because how instruction-cache
coherence is maintained is considered a platform issue for
microcontrollers.

- Misaligned loads and stores may be supported.

- *Zicntr* Basic counters.

- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.

- *Zicbom* Cache-Block Management Operations.
- *Zicboz* Cache-Block Zero Operations.

- *Zicfisslp* Shadow-stack and landing pads.

- *Zkt* Data-independent execution time.

- *Zfa* Additional scalar FP instructions.

- *Zfhmin* Half-Precision Floating-point transfer and convert.

- *Zfh* Half-precision floating-point instructions.

- *Zfbfmin* Scalar BF16 FP conversions.
- *Zvfbfmin* Vector BF16 FP conversions.
- *Zvfbfwma* Vector BF16 widening mul-add.

- *Zbc* Scalar carryless multiply.

- *Zve32x*
- *Zve32f*
- *Zve64x*
- *Zve64f*
- *Zve64d*
- *Zvfhmin* Vector half-precision floating-point conversion instructions
- *Zvfh* Vector half-precision floating-point instructions.

- *Zkn* Scalar Crypto NIST Algorithms.
- *Zks* Scalar Crypto ShangMi Algorithms.
- *Zkr*  Entropy CSR.

- *Zvkng* Vector Crypto NIST Algorithms including GHASH.
- *Zvksg* Vector Crypto ShangMi Algorithms including GHASH.

- *Zvbb* Vector bitmanip extension.
- *Zvbc* Vector carryless multiply.

- *Zvkg* Vector GHASH instructions
- *Zvkn* Vector Crypto NIST Algorithms
- *Zvks* Vector Crypto ShangMi Algorithms

but where either of Zvkn or Zvks is implemented, either Zvbc or Zvkg
must also be implemented.

NOTE: Should probably define new Zvknc and Zvksc extensions to
represent Zvknn + Zvbc and Zvsn + Zvbc respectively.

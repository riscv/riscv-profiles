== Introduction

RISC-V was designed to provide a highly modular and extensible
instruction set, and includes a large and growing set of standard
extensions.  In addition, users may add their own custom
extensions. This flexibility can be used to highly optimize a
specialized design by including only the exact set of ISA features
required for an application, but the same flexibility also leads to a
combinatorial explosion in possible ISA choices.  Profiles specify a
much smaller common set of ISA choices that capture the most value for
most users, and which thereby enable the software community to focus
resources on building a rich software ecosystem with application and
operating system portability across different implementations.

NOTE: Another pragmatic concern is the long and unwieldy ISA strings
required to encode common sets of extensions, which will continue to
grow as new extensions are defined.

Each profile is built on a standard base ISA plus a set of mandatory
ISA extensions, and provides a small set of standard ISA options to
extend the mandatory components.  Profiles provide a convenient
shorthand for describing the ISA portions of hardware and software
platforms, and also guide the development of common software
toolchains shared by different platforms that use the same profile.
The intent is that the software ecosystem focus on supporting the
profiles' mandatory base and standard options, instead of attempting
to support every possible combination of individual extensions.
Similarly, hardware vendors should aim to structure their offerings
around standard profiles to increase the likelihood their designs will
have mainstream software support.

NOTE: Profiles are not intended to prohibit the use of combinations of
individual ISA extensions or the addition of custom extensions, which
can continue to be used for more specialized applications albeit
without the expectation of widespread software support or portability
between hardware platforms.

NOTE: As RISC-V evolves over time, the set of ISA features will grow,
and new platforms will be added that may need different profiles.  To
manage this evolution, RISC-V is adopting a model of regular annual
releases of new ISA profiles, following an ISA roadmap managed by the
RISC-V Technical Steering Committee.  The architecture profiles will
also be used for branding and to advertise compatibility with the
RISC-V standard.

This document describes the general structure of RISC-V architecture
profiles and also the specifics of the first few profiles: RVI20 is a
generic RISC-V unprivileged software profile, and RVA20 and RVA22 are
architecture profiles for application processors.

== Profiles versus Platforms

Profiles only describe ISA features, not a complete execution
environment.

A _software_ _platform_ is a specification for an execution
environment, in which software targeted for that software platform can
run.

A _hardware_ _platform_ is a specification for a hardware system
(which can be viewed as a physical realization of an execution
environment).

Both software and hardware platforms include specifications for many
features beyond details of the ISA used by RISC-V harts in the
platform (e.g., boot process, calling convention, behavior of
environment calls, discovery mechanism, presence of certain
memory-mapped hardware devices, etc.).  Architecture profiles factor
out ISA-specific definitions from platform definitions to allow ISA
profiles to be reused across different platforms, and to be used by
tools (e.g., compilers) that are common across many different
platforms.

A platform can add additional constraints on top of those in a
profile.  For example, mandating an extension that is a standard
option in the underlying profile, or constraining some
implementation-specific parameter in the profile to lie within a
certain range.

A platform cannot remove mandates or reduce other requirements in a
profile.

NOTE: A new profile should be proposed if existing profiles do not
match the needs of a new platform.

== Components of a Profile

=== Profile Family

Every profile is a member of a _profile_ _family_.  A profile family
is a set of profiles that share the same base ISA but which vary in
highest-supported privilege mode.  The initial two types of family
are:

- generic unprivileged instructions (I)
- application processors running rich operating systems (A)

NOTE: More profile families may be added over time.

A profile family may be updated no more than annually, and the release
calendar year is treated as part of the profile family name.

Each profile family is described in more detail below.

=== Profile Privilege Mode

RISC-V has a layered architecture supporting multiple privilege modes,
and most RISC-V platforms support more than one privilege mode.
Software is usually written assuming a particular privilege mode
during execution.  For example, application code is written assuming
it will be run in user mode, and kernel code is written assuming it
will be run in supervisor mode.

NOTE: Software can be run in a mode different than the one for which
it was written. For example, privileged code using privileged ISA
features can be run in a user-mode execution environment, but will
then cause traps into the enclosing execution environment when
privileged instructions are executed.  This behavior might be
exploited, for example, to emulate a privileged execution environment
using a user-mode execution environment.

The profile for a privilege mode describes the ISA features for an
execution environment that has the eponymous privilege mode as the
most-privileged mode available, but also includes all supported
lower-privilege modes.  In general, available instructions vary by
privilege mode, and the behavior of RISC-V instructions can depend on
the current privilege mode.  For example, an S-mode profile includes
U-mode as well as S-mode and describes the behavior of instructions
when running in different modes in an S-mode execution environment,
such as how an `ecall` instruction in U-mode causes a contained trap
into an S-mode handler whereas an `ecall` in S-mode causes a requested
trap out to the execution environment.

A profile may specify that certain conditions will cause a requested
trap (such as an `ecall` made in the highest-supported privilege mode)
or fatal trap to the enclosing execution environment.  The profile
does not specify the behavior of the enclosing execution environment
in handling requested or fatal traps.

NOTE: In particular, a profile does not specify the set of ECALLs
available in the outer execution environment.  This should be
documented in the appropriate binary interface to the outer execution
environment (e.g., Linux user ABI, or RISC-V SEE).

NOTE: In general, a profile can be implemented by an execution
environment using any hardware or software technique that provides
compatible functionality, including pure software emulation.

A profile does not specify any invisible traps.

NOTE: In particular, a profile does not constrain how invisible traps
to a more-privileged mode can be used to emulate profile features.

A more-privileged profile can always support running software to
implement a less-privileged profile from the same profile family.  For
example, a platform supporting the S-mode profile can run a
supervisor-mode operating system that provides user-mode execution
environments supporting the U-mode profile.

NOTE: Instructions in a U-mode profile, which are all executed in user
mode, have potentially different behaviors than instructions executed
in user mode in an S-mode profile.  For this reason, a U-mode profile
cannot be considered a subset of an S-mode profile.

=== Profile ISA Features

An architecture profile has a mandatory ratified base instruction set
(RV32I or RV64I for the current profiles).  The profile also includes
ratified ISA extensions placed into two categories:

. Mandatory
. Optional

As the name implies, _Mandatory_ _ISA_ _extensions_ are a required
part of the profile.  Implementations of the profile must provide
these.  The combination of the profile base ISA plus the mandatory ISA
extensions are termed the profile _mandates_, and software using the
profile can assume these always exist.

The _Optional_ category (also known as _options_) contains extensions
that may be added as options, and which are expected to be generally
supported as options by the software ecosystem for this profile.

NOTE: The level of "support" for an Optional extension will likely
vary greatly among different software components supporting a profile.
Users would expect that software claiming compatibility with a profile
would make use of any available supported options, but as a bare
minimum software should not report errors or warnings when supported
options are present in a system.

An optional extension may comprise many individually named and
ratified extensions but a profile option requires all constituent
extensions are present.  In particular, unless explicitly listed as a
profile option, individual extensions are not by themselves a profile
option even when required as part of a profile option.  For example,
the Zbkb extension is not by itself a profile option even though it is a
required component of the Zkn option.

NOTE: Profile optional extensions are intended to capture the
granularity at which the broad software ecosystem is expected to cope
with combinations of extensions.

All components of a ratified profile must themselves have been
ratified.

Platforms may provide a discovery mechanism to determine what optional
extensions are present.

Extensions that are not explicitly listed in the mandatory or optional
categories are termed _non-profile_ extensions, and are not considered
parts of the profile.  Some non-profile extensions can be added to an
implementation without conflicting with the mandatory or optional
components of a profile.  In this case, the implementation is still
compatible with the profile even though additional non-profile
extensions are present.  Other non-profile extensions added to an
implementation might alter or conflict with the behavior of the
mandatory or optional extensions in a profile, in which case the
implementation would not be compatible with the profile.

NOTE: Extensions that are released after a given profile is released
are by definition non-profile extensions.  For example, mandatory or
optional profile extensions for a new profile might be prototyped as
non-profile extensions on an earlier profile.

=== Profile Naming Convention

A profile name is a string comprised of, in order:

. Prefix *RV* for RISC-V.
. A specific profile family name string.  Initially a single letter (*I*, *M*, or *A*), but later profiles may have longer family name strings.
. A numeric string giving the first complete calendar year for which
the profile is ratified, represented as number of years after year
2000, i.e., *20* for profiles built on specifications ratified during 2019. The year string will be longer than two digits in the next century.
. A privilege mode (*U*, *S*, *M*).  Hypervisor support is treated as an option.
. A base ISA XLEN specifier (*32*, *64*).

The initial profiles based on specifications ratified in 2019 are:

- RVI20U32 basic unprivileged instructions for RV32I
- RVI20U64 basic unprivileged instructions for RV64I
- RVA20U64, RVA20S64 64-bit application-processor profiles

NOTE: Profile names are embeddable into RISC-V ISA naming strings.
This implies that there will be no standard ISA extension with a name
that matches the profile naming convention.  This allows tools that
process the RISC-V ISA naming string to parse and/or process a combined
string.

== RVI20 Profiles

The RVI20 profiles document the initial set of unprivileged
instructions.  These provide a generic target for software toolchains
and represent the minimum level of compatibility with RISC-V ratified
standards.  The two profiles RVI20U32 and RVI20U64 correspond to the
RV32I and RV64I base ISAs respectively.

NOTE: These are designed as _unprivileged_ profiles as opposed to
_user_-_mode_ profiles.  Code using this profile can run in any
privilege mode, and so requested and fatal traps may be horizontal
traps into an execution environment running in the same privilege
mode.

=== RVI20U32

RVI20U32 specifies the ISA features available to generic unprivileged
execution environments.

==== RVI20U32 Mandatory Base

RV32I is the mandatory base ISA for RVI20U32, and is little-endian.

As per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

Misaligned loads and stores might not be supported.

The `fence.tso` instruction is mandatory.

NOTE: The `fence.tso` instruction was incorrectly described as
optional in the 2019 ratified specifications. However, `fence.tso` is
encoded within the standard `fence` encoding such that implementations
must treat it as a simple global fence if they do not natively support
TSO-ordering optimizations.  As software can always assume without any
penalty that `fence.tso` is being exploited by a hardware
implementation, there is no advantage to making the instruction an
option.  Later versions of the unprivileged ISA specifications
correctly indicate that `fence.tso` is mandatory.

==== RVI20U32 Mandatory Extensions

There are no mandatory extensions for RVI20U32.

==== RVI20U32 Optional Extensions

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.

- *A* Atomic instructions.

- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
  
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.

NOTE: The rationale to not include Q as an optional extension is that
quad-precision floating-point is unlikely to be implemented in
hardware, and so we do not require or expect software to expend effort
optimizing use of Q instructions in case they are present.

- *C* Compressed Instructions.

- *Zifencei* Instruction-fetch fence instruction.

- Misaligned loads and stores may be supported.

- *Zicntr* Basic counters.

NOTE: The Zicsr extension is not supported independent of the Zicntr or
F extensions.

- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.

=== RVI20U64

RVI20U64 specifies the ISA features available to generic unprivileged
execution environments.

==== RVI20U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVI20U64, and is little-endian.

As per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

Misaligned loads and stores might not be supported.

The `fence.tso` instruction is mandatory.

NOTE: The `fence.tso` instruction was incorrectly described as
optional in the 2019 ratified specifications. However, `fence.tso` is
encoded within the standard `fence` encoding such that implementations
must treat it as a simple global fence if they do not natively support
TSO-ordering optimizations.  As software can always assume without any
penalty that `fence.tso` is being exploited by a hardware
implementation, there is no advantage to making the instruction a
profile option.  Later versions of the unprivileged ISA specifications
correctly indicate that `fence.tso` is mandatory.

==== RVI20U64 Mandatory Extensions

There are no mandatory extensions for RVI20U64.

==== RVI20U64 Optional Extensions

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.

- *A* Atomic instructions.

- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
  
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.

NOTE: The rationale to not include Q as a profile option is that
quad-precision floating-point is unlikely to be implemented in
hardware, and so we do not require or expect software to expend effort
optimizing use of Q instructions in case they are present.

- *C* Compressed Instructions.

- *Zifencei* Instruction-fetch fence instruction.

- Misaligned loads and stores may be supported.

- *Zicntr* Basic counters.

NOTE: The Zicsr extension is not supported independent of the Zicntr or
F extensions.

- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.

== RVA20 Profiles

The RVA20 profiles are intended to be used for 64-bit application
processors running rich OS stacks.  Only user-mode (RVA20U64) and
supervisor-mode (RVA20S64) profiles are specified in this family.

NOTE: There is no machine-mode profile currently defined for
application processor families.  A machine-mode profile for
application processors would only be used in specifying platforms for
portable machine-mode software. Given the relatively low volume of
portable M-mode software in this domain, the wide variety of potential
M-mode code, and the very specific needs of each type of M-mode
software, we are not specifying individual M-mode ISA requirements in
the A-family profiles.

NOTE: Only XLEN=64 application processor profiles are currently
defined.  It would be possible to also define very similar XLEN=32
variants.

=== RVA20U64 Profile

The RVA20U64 profile specifies the ISA features available to user-mode
execution environments in 64-bit applications processors.  This is the
most important profile within the application processor family in
terms of the amount of software that targets this profile.

RVA20U64 has one optional extension (Zihpm).

==== RVA20U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA20U64, and is little-endian.

As per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

The `fence.tso` instruction is mandatory.

NOTE: The `fence.tso` instruction was incorrectly described as
optional in the 2019 ratified specifications. However, `fence.tso` is
encoded within the standard `fence` encoding such that implementations
must treat it as a simple global fence if they do not natively support
TSO-ordering optimizations.  As software can always assume without any
penalty that `fence.tso` is being exploited by a hardware
implementation, there is no advantage to making the instruction a
profile option.  Later versions of the unprivileged ISA
specifications correctly indicate that `fence.tso` is mandatory.

==== RVA20U64 Mandatory Extensions

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.
- *A* Atomic instructions.
- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.
- *C* Compressed Instructions.
- *Zicsr*  CSR instructions.  These are implied by presence of Zicntr or F.
- *Zicntr* Basic counters.

- *Ziccif* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
  coherence PMAs must support instruction fetch, and any instruction
  fetches of naturally aligned power-of-2 sizes up to min(ILEN,XLEN)
  (i.e., 32 bits for RVA20) are atomic.

NOTE: Ziccif is a new extension name capturing this feature.  The
fetch atomicity requirement facilitates runtime patching of aligned
instructions.

- *Ziccrse* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must
  support RsrvEventual.

NOTE: Ziccrse is a new extension name capturing this feature.

- *Ziccamoa* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must
  support AMOArithmetic.

NOTE: Ziccamoa is a new extension name capturing this feature.

- *Za128rs* Reservation sets must be contiguous, naturally aligned,
   and at most 128 bytes in size.

NOTE: Za128rs is a new extension name capturing this feature.  The
minimum reservation set size is effectively determined by the size of
atomic accesses in the A extension.

- *Zicclsm* Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the
  cacheability and coherence PMAs must be supported.

NOTE: This introduces a new extension name for this feature.  This
requires misaligned support for all regular load and store
instructions (including scalar and vector) but not AMOs or other
specialized forms of memory access.  Even though mandated, misaligned
loads and stores might execute extremely slowly.  Standard software
distributions should assume their existence only for correctness, not
for performance.

==== RVA20U64 Optional Extensions

- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.

NOTE: Hardware performance counters are a supported option in RVA20.
The number of counters is platform-specific.

NOTE: The rationale to not make Q an optional extension is that
quad-precision floating-point is unlikely to be implemented in
hardware, and so we do not require or expect A-profile software to
expend effort optimizing use of Q instructions in case they are
present.

NOTE: Zifencei is not classed as a supported option in the user-mode
profile because it is not sufficient by itself to produce the desired
effect in a multiprogrammed multiprocessor environment without OS
support, and so the instruction cache flush should always be performed
using an OS call rather than using the `fence.i` instruction.
`fence.i` semantics can be expensive to implement for some hardware
memory hierarchy designs, and so alternative non-standard
instruction-cache coherence mechanisms can be used behind the OS
abstraction.  A separate extension is being developed for more general
and efficient instruction cache coherence.

NOTE: The execution environment must provide a means to synchronize writes to
instruction memory with instruction fetches, the implementation of which
likely relies on the Zifencei extension.
For example, RISC-V Linux supplies the `__riscv_flush_icache` system call and
a corresponding vDSO call.

==== RVA20U64 Recommendations

Recommendations are not strictly mandated but are included to guide
implementers making design choices.

Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.

=== RVA20S64 Profile

The RVA20S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVA20S64 is based on privileged architecture version
1.11.

RVA20S64 has one unprivileged option (Zihpm) and one privileged option
(Sv48).

==== RVA20S64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA20S64, and is little-endian.

The `ecall` instruction operates as per the unprivileged architecture
specification.  An `ecall` in user mode causes a contained trap to
supervisor mode.  An `ecall` in supervisor mode causes a requested
trap to the execution environment.

==== RVA20S64 Mandatory Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are mandatory:

- The RVA20S64 mandatory unprivileged extensions include all the
mandatory unprivileged extensions in RVA20U64.

- *Zifencei*  Instruction-Fetch Fence.

NOTE: Zifencei is mandated as it is the only standard way to support
instruction-cache coherence in RVA20 application processors.  A new
instruction-cache coherence mechanism is under development which might
be added as an option in the future.

The following privileged extensions are mandatory:

- *Ss1p11*  Privileged Architecture version 1.11.

- *Svbare* The `satp` mode Bare must be supported.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Sv39* Page-Based 39-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svade* Page-fault exceptions are raised when a page is accessed
   when A bit is clear, or written when D bit is clear.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Ssccptr* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
   coherence PMAs must support hardware page-table reads.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Sstvecd* `stvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).  When
  `stvec.MODE=Direct`, `stvec.BASE` must be capable of holding any
  valid four-byte-aligned address.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Sstvala* `stval` must be written with the faulting virtual address for load,
  store, and instruction page-fault, access-fault, and misaligned
  exceptions, and for breakpoint exceptions other than those caused by
  execution of the `ebreak` or `c.ebreak` instructions.  For
  illegal-instruction exceptions, `stval` must be written with the
  faulting instruction.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

==== RVA20S64 Optional Extensions

RVA20S64 has one unprivileged option.

- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.

NOTE: The number of counters is platform-specific.

RVA20S64 has the following privileged options:

- *Sv48* Page-Based 48-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Ssu64xl* `sstatus.UXL` must be capable of holding the value 2
(i.e., UXLEN=64 must be supported).

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

== RVA22 Profiles

The RVA22 profiles are intended to be used for 64-bit application
processors running rich OS stacks.  Only user-mode (RVA22U64) and
supervisor-mode (RVA22S64) profiles are specified in this family.

=== RVA22U64 Profile

The RVA22U64 profile specifies the ISA features available to user-mode
execution environments in 64-bit applications processors.  This is the
most important profile within the application processor family in
terms of the amount of software that targets this profile.

==== RVA22U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA22U64, including mandatory `fence.tso`, and is little-endian.

NOTE: Later versions of the RV64I unprivileged ISA specification
ratified in 2021 made clear that `fence.tso` is mandatory.

As per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

==== RVA22U64 Mandatory Extensions

The following mandatory extensions were present in RVA20U64.

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.
- *A* Atomic instructions.
- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.
- *C* Compressed Instructions.
- *Zicsr*  CSR instructions.  These are implied by presence of F.
- *Zicntr* Base counters and timers.

- *Ziccif* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
  coherence PMAs must support instruction fetch, and any instruction
  fetches of naturally aligned power-of-2 sizes up to min(ILEN,XLEN)
  (i.e., 32 bits for RVA22) are atomic.

- *Ziccrse* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support RsrvEventual.

NOTE: Ziccrse is a new extension name capturing this feature.

- *Ziccamoa* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support AMOArithmetic.

NOTE: Ziccamoa is a new extension name capturing this feature.

- *Zicclsm* Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the
  cacheability and coherence PMAs must be supported.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature. Even though
mandated, misaligned loads and stores might execute extremely slowly.
Standard software distributions should assume their existence only for
correctness, not for performance.

The following mandatory feature was further restricted in RVA22U64:

- *Za64rs* Reservation sets are contiguous, naturally aligned, and a
   maximum of 64 bytes.

NOTE: This is a new extension name capturing this feature.  The
maximum reservation size has been reduced to match the required cache
block size.  The minimum reservation size is effectively set by the
instructions in the mandatory A extension.

The following mandatory extensions are new for RVA22U64.

- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.

NOTE: Zihpm was optional in RVA20U64.

- *Zihintpause* Pause instruction.

NOTE: While the `pause` instruction is a HINT can be implemented as a
NOP and hence trivially supported by hardware implementers, its
inclusion in the mandatory extension list signifies that software
should use the instruction whenever it would make sense and that
implementors are expected to exploit this information to optimize
hardware execution.

- *Zba* Address computation.
- *Zbb* Basic bit manipulation.
- *Zbs* Single-bit instructions.

- *Zic64b* Cache blocks must be 64 bytes in size, naturally aligned in the
address space.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature. While the general
RISC-V specifications are agnostic to cache block size, selecting a
common cache block size simplifies the specification and use of the
following cache-block extensions within the application processor
profile. Software does not have to query a discovery mechanism and/or
provide dynamic dispatch to the appropriate code. We choose 64 bytes
at it is effectively an industry standard. Implementations may use
longer cache blocks to reduce tag cost provided they use 64-byte
sub-blocks to remain compatible. Implementations may use shorter cache
blocks provided they sequence cache operations across the multiple
cache blocks comprising a 64-byte block to remain compatible.

- *Zicbom* Cache-Block Management Operations.
- *Zicbop* Cache-Block Prefetch Operations.

NOTE: As with other HINTS, the inclusion of prefetches in the
mandatory set of extensions indicates that software should generate
these instructions where they are expected to be useful, and hardware
is expected to exploit that information.

- *Zicboz* Cache-Block Zero Operations.

- *Zfhmin* Half-Precision Floating-point transfer and convert.

NOTE: Zfhmin is a small extension that adds support to load/store and
convert IEEE FP16 numbers to and from IEEE FP32 format.  The hardware
cost for this extension is low, and mandating the extension avoids
adding an option to the profile.

- *Zkt* Data-independent execution time.

NOTE: Zkt requires a certain subset of integer instructions execute
with data-independent latency.  Mandating this feature enables
portable libraries for safe basic cryptographic operations. It is
expected that application processors will naturally have this property
and so implementation cost is low, if not zero, in most systems that
would support RVA22.

==== RVA22U64 Optional Extensions

RVA22U64 has four profile options (Zfh, V, Zkn, Zks):

- *Zfh* Half-Precision Floating-Point.

NOTE: A future profile might mandate Zfh.

- *V* Vector Extension.

NOTE: The smaller vector extensions (Zve32f, Zve32x, Zve64d, Zve64f,
Zve64x) are not provided as separately supported profile options. The
full V extension is specified as the only supported profile option.

NOTE: A future profile might mandate V.

- *Zkn* Scalar Crypto NIST Algorithms.
- *Zks* Scalar Crypto ShangMi Algorithms.

NOTE: The scalar crypto extensions are expected to be superseded by
vector crypto standards in future profiles, and the scalar extensions
may be removed as supported options once vector crypto is present.

NOTE: The smaller component scalar crypto extensions (Zbc, Zbkb, Zbkc,
Zbkx, Zknd, Zkne, Zknh, Zksed, Zksh) are not provided as separate
options in the profile.  Profile implementers should provide all of
the instructions in a given algorithm suite as part of the Zkn or Zks
supported options.

NOTE: Access to the entropy source (Zkr) in a system is usually
carefully controlled.  While the design supports unprivileged access
to the entropy source, this is unlikely to be commonly used in an
application processor, and so Zkr was not added as a profile option.
This also means the roll-up Zk was not added as a profile option.

NOTE: The Zfinx, Zdinx, Zhinx, Zhinxmin extensions are incompatible
with the profile mandates to support the F and D extensions.

==== RVA22U64 Recommendations

Recommendations are not strictly mandated but are included to guide
implementers making design choices.

Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.

=== RVA22S64 Profile

The RVA22S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVA22S64 is based on privileged architecture version
1.12.

==== RVA22S64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA22S64, including mandatory
`fence.tso`, and is little-endian.

NOTE: Later versions of the RV64I unprivileged ISA specification
ratified in 2021 made clear that `fence.tso` is mandatory.

The `ecall` instruction operates as per the unprivileged architecture
specification.  An `ecall` in user mode causes a contained trap to
supervisor mode.  An `ecall` in supervisor mode causes a requested
trap to the execution environment.

==== RVA22S64 Mandatory Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are mandatory:

- The RVA22S64 mandatory unprivileged extensions include all the
mandatory unprivileged extensions in RVA22U64.

- *Zifencei*  Instruction-Fetch Fence.

NOTE: Zifencei is mandated as it is the only standard way to support
instruction-cache coherence in RVA22 application processors.  A new
instruction-cache coherence mechanism is under development which might
be added as an option in the future.

The following privileged extensions are mandatory:

- *Ss1p12*  Privileged Architecture version 1.12.

NOTE: Ss1p12 supersedes Ss1p11.

- *Svbare* The `satp` mode Bare must be supported.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Sv39* Page-Based 39-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svade* Page-fault exceptions are raised when a page is accessed
   when A bit is clear, or written when D bit is clear.

- *Ssccptr* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
   coherence PMAs must support hardware page-table reads.

- *Sstvecd* `stvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0
  (Direct).  When `stvec.MODE=Direct`, `stvec.BASE` must be capable of
  holding any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- *Sstvala* stval must be written with the faulting virtual address
  for load, store, and instruction page-fault, access-fault, and
  misaligned exceptions, and for breakpoint exceptions other than
  those caused by execution of the EBREAK or C.EBREAK instructions.
  For illegal-instruction exceptions, stval must be written with the
  faulting instruction.

- *Sscounterenw* For any hpmcounter that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit in scounteren must be writable.

NOTE: This is new extension name capturing this feature.

- *Svpbmt* Page-Based Memory Types

- *Svinval* Fine-Grained Address-Translation Cache Invalidation

==== RVA22S64 Optional Extensions

RVA22S64 has four unprivileged options (Zfh, V, Zkn, Zks) from
RVA22U64, and eight privileged options (Sv48, Sv57, Svnapot, Ssu64xl,
Sstc, Sscofpmf, Zkr, H).

The privileged optional extensions are:

- *Sv48* Page-Based 48-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Sv57* Page-Based 57-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svnapot* NAPOT Translation Contiguity

NOTE: It is expected that Svnapot will be mandatory in the next
profile release.

- *Ssu64xl* `sstatus.UXL` must be capable of holding the value 2
(i.e., UXLEN=64 must be supported).

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Sstc* supervisor-mode timer interrupts.

NOTE: Sstc was not made mandatory in RVA22S64 as it is a more
disruptive change affecting system-level architecture, and will take
longer for implementations to adopt.  It is expected to be made
mandatory in the next profile release.

- *Sscofpmf* Count Overflow and Mode-Based Filtering.

NOTE: Platforms may choose to mandate the presence of Sscofpmf.

- *Zkr*  Entropy CSR.

NOTE: Technically, Zk is also a privileged-mode option capturing that
Zkr, Zkn, and Zkt are all implemented.  However, the Zk rollup is less
descriptive than specifying the individual extensions explicitly.

- *H* The hypervisor extension.

When the hypervisor extension is implemented, the following are also mandatory:

- *Ssstateen* Supervisor-mode view of the state-enable extension.  The
   supervisor-mode (`sstateen0-3`) and hypervisor-mode (`hstateen0-3`)
   state-enable registers must be provided.

NOTE: The Smstateen extension specification is an M-mode extension as
it includes M-mode features, but the supervisor-mode visible
components of the extension are named as the Ssstateen extension.  Only
Ssstateen is mandated in the RVA22S64 profile when the hypervisor
extension is implemented.  These registers are not mandated or
supported options without the hypervisor extension, as there are no
RVA22S64 supported options with relevant state to control in the
absence of the hypervisor extension.

- *Shcounterenw* For any `hpmcounter` that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit in `hcounteren` must be writable.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Shvstvala* `vstval` must be written in all cases described above for `stval`.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Shtvala* `htval` must be written with the faulting guest physical
   address in all circumstances permitted by the ISA.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Shvstvecd* `vstvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).
  When `vstvec.MODE`=Direct, `vstvec.BASE` must be capable of holding
  any valid four-byte-aligned address.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Shvsatpa* All translation modes supported in `satp` must be supported in `vsatp`.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

- *Shgatpa* For each supported virtual memory scheme SvNN supported in
  `satp`, the corresponding hgatp SvNNx4 mode must be supported.  The
  `hgatp` mode Bare must also be supported.

NOTE: This is a new extension name for this feature.

==== RVA22S64 Recommendations

- Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
  exceptions when attempting to execute unimplemented opcodes.
